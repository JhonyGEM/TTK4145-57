To run: go run main.go -id=pop -Successor


# Communication redundancy
each event (new reques) need an unique id
when elevator recieves request it will send it to master and save it pending array until it gets ack, it will be resedn if no ack in certain time window
master will recive the message, handle the event, send copy to sucsessor and wait for ack before sending request and ack to elevator
      the pending array will be of type message and will be keyed by event id (time at the event was send + id of client)
